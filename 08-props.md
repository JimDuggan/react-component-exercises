# Props


1. Write a component that renders a "Contact" card for a person. The `<Contact>` component should accept a name, an address and an email as props, and display them. The address should be displayed using an `<Address>` component.
2. Render three contact cards. Take them from this
  [contacts.json](https://gist.github.com/petermunro/810619d9fb2e03e757f484a57f2fd9fd) file. You can import this using:

        import contacts from './contacts.json';
