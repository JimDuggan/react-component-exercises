# Getting Started with create-react-app

To get started with React, we will use `create-react-app`. It runs on the 'node' platform, whose installer gives you both the `node` and `npm` commands.

If the commands below don't succeed, go through the [prerequisites](01-prerequisites.md) first.


1. If you haven't already done so, install `create-react-app` like this:

        $ npm install -g create-react-app

2. Create a project `my-app`, and start the development server:

        $ create-react-app hello
        $ cd hello
        $ npm start

3. This should open a browser on your project.
