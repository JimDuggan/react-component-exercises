# Getting Started with create-react-app

To get started with React, we will use `create-react-app`.

> Conventions: I use the `$` to indicate a shell prompt and commands you type at the shell

1. Install it like this:

        $ npm install -g create-react-app

2. Create a project `hello`, and start the development server:

        $ create-react-app hello
        $ cd hello
        $ yarn start

3. This should open a browser on your project.
